# ** Dungeons 'n' Dads ** is a project i am working on both as a source of amusement and education for my kids and for me to practice programming in a blockchain environment.

The main code is not kept here full time but uploaded occasionally for testing purposes and to get insight and improvements from the community and better programmers than myself. 

The game has been fully working as a standalone for some time but I am hoping with this new attempt to improve on past mistakes and to learn along th way, specifically;-

* I want to make the game blockchain compatible to improve my skills.
* I want to add a better learning element to the game engine (simple AI)
* I want to improve my python programming as I previously programmed C++
I want to design the game in  a more modular fashion that will allow me to change the educational focus of the game more dynamically.
